Dr. Karan Sikka is a Senior Computer Vision Scientist at [SRI International](https://www.sri.com/computer-vision/), Princeton, USA. 
He completed his PhD from [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) in 2016 (advised by [Dr. Marian Bartlett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marian-bartlett-92545ba/)). He completed his bachelors in ECE from [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/), India in 2010.

Dr. Sikka's doctoral [thesis](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9713p3nd) centered on developing machine learning models for [action classification](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Sikka_LOMo_Latent_Ordinal_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) in videos, specifically under conditions of weak supervision. Upon joining SRI, his research trajectory shifted towards multimodal learning, emphasizing approaches for learning under [few/zero-shot](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Ankan_Bansal_Zero-Shot_Object_Detection_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf) settings. He explored the utilization of diverse modalities to enhance various tasks, spanning from [visual grounding](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Datta_Align2Ground_Weakly_Supervised_Phrase_Grounding_Guided_by_Image-Caption_Alignment_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf) to [social media-analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07075.pdf) and [geo-localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05695). His present research concentrate on leveraging large language models (Generative AI), across a spectrum of applications including [robotics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04077.pdf), [visual understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10081), personalized content generation. Furthermore, he is also interested in enhancing the [consistency](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04461.pdf) of these models and mitigating issues such as hallucination.
His work has been [published](/publications/) at high quality venues such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, and also won multiple [awards](/misc/).
